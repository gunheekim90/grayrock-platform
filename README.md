## About Grayrock platform

Gray Rock is a platform that introduces algorithm-based automated trading bots to crypto investors. Currently, a large number of developers are developing high-quality trading bots through numerous trials and errors and backtesting, but due to the lack of appropriate means to promote them, there are not enough customers to use the bot. Conversely, a greater number of individual investors are hoping for stable cryptocurrency investment and management, but it is difficult to find other investment agency products and services except for direct investment.

The Gray Rock platform provides information on various trading bots, each bot's performance, past investment history, management strategy, and base algorithm to the public. Through Graylock, individual investors can compare and analyze various trading bots to select the bot that best suits their personal preferences, and developers can easily access a larger number of public and secure potential customers. Overall, Graylock is a platform that can provide useful value to all market participants because it dramatically reduces the gap between the existing trading bot developers and individual investors, and enables more professional cryptocurrency asset management at a reasonable cost.
